# 🌐 Deploy Your Safety Object Detection App Online

## Quick Start (5 Minutes!) ⚡

### Method 1: Using the Quick Deploy Script (EASIEST)

```bash
cd Hackathon2_scripts
./quick_deploy.sh
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions!

## Method 2: Manual Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
cd /Users/mohammadansari/Desktop/Hackathon/Hackathon2_scripts
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Safety Object Detection App - Ready to deploy"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** button → **"New repository"**
3. Name it (e.g., `safety-detection-app`)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### Step 4: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click **"Sign in"** with GitHub
3. Click **"New app"**
4. Select your repository
5. Main file path: `app.py`
6. Click **"Deploy"**

🎉 **Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes at:**
```
https://YOUR-APP-NAME.streamlit.app
```

## Requirements for Deployment

Your app needs these files (✅ all included):

- ✅ `app.py` - Main application
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ✅ `yolo_params.yaml` - Model config
- ✅ `runs/detect/train2/weights/best.pt` - Trained model
- ✅ All supporting files

---

## After Deployment - What You Can Do

1. **Share with anyone**: Send them your app URL
2. **Use on mobile**: Works on phones/tablets
3. **Embed in websites**: Add to your portfolio
4. **Update easily**: Just push to GitHub

---

## Updating Your Deployed App

Just make changes and push to GitHub:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Updated app"
git push
```

Streamlit Cloud **auto-updates** your app! 🎉

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Model not found" error
- Ensure `runs/detect/train2/weights/best.pt` is committed to Git
- Check file is under 100MB

### "Module not found" error
- Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Check that you're using the correct Python version

### Deployment fails
- Check the Streamlit Cloud logs
- Ensure all paths are relative
- Verify the model file exists

---

## Model Size Note

Your model is ~64MB. If GitHub complains:
1. Use Git LFS for large files:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.pt"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add runs/detect/train2/weights/best.pt
   ```

---

## Security & Privacy

- ✅ Your model stays private
- ✅ Streamlit Cloud is secure
- ✅ No data is stored (images processed on-the-fly)
- ✅ HTTPS enabled by default
